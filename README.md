# TransferMarkt-WebScraper
## About
This project is a Python-based web scraper that collects detailed data on attackers (forwards, wingers & attacking midfielders) in the top five European football leagues (Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A, & Ligue 1) from [Transfermarkt](https://www.transfermarkt.com/) . The scraper fetches information from public football databases, providing stats such as goals, assists, minutes played, and several other key metrics. Built using Python with libraries like `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `pandas` for efficient data retrieval and management.
The scraped data is stored in an easy-to-use CSV file for further analysis and use in machine learning or data visualization projects.
Unfortunately, the website has been totally revamped & the project is now of no use as this scraper was used for a older version of the website and isn't working for the newer version. Feel free to use the dataset in `players_data.csv`.
